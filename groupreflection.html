        <h4><u>Sweta</u></h4>
            <p>I found the team worked really well for Assignment 3; better than we worked in the previous assignment. For example, because I am from a Marketing background, I was good at getting the team to interact and communicate with each other. Whereas everyone else such as Taneshwar, Minh, Kim, Sing and Nick were good at listening and being cooperative.
            I believe that’s because we know each other better and have worked together before. 
            <br>
            We worked a lot more collaboratively than last time and made an effort to ensure we work together more often by scheduling more team meetings. Group interaction could have been better; however everyone made a solid effort this time around. One thing that I’ve learnt about working in groups that you have to be patient, and be open to listening to others and open to feedback – not everyone is going to agree with you and that’s okay. One thing that was surprising is how well we could delegate the tasks to each other; everyone was open to any task and wasn’t being fussy or picky which was really nice.</p>
        
        <h4><u>Taneshwar</u></h4>
            <p>Overall our group worked well together. I felt that the collaboration was better than assignment 2 as everyone started to feel comfortable working together. We also split up tasks in a way that allowed us to collaborate better which was a crucial part of this assignment as it was worth so much. I felt everyone did their allocated tasks properly and on time. Something that was surprising to me was that we got a lot of work done even though we changed project ideas half way through. We could definitely improve on the group collaboration element of the project as there is still room for improvement, we could’ve communicated better and held meetings more frequently. One thing I learnt about the group is that everyone was very hardworking and they completed all the tasks that were assigned to them. Another thing that I learnt was that dedicating leadership is a vital part of group work as it allows for the project to flow smoothly. We did not use GitHub for logging activities as we didn’t have enough time to get multiple people to work on the website therefore we allocated the website to one person and then had others help out where necessary.</p>
        
        <h4><u>Kimberley</u></h4>
            <p>Similarly to our previous assignment, we were able to delegate tasks easily and in comparison were able to work a bit more collaboratively this time. As we have now worked with each other previously, I feel that we were more comfortable working together and we also had Sweta and Taneshwar who kind of took up the leadership roles while everyone else cooperated well. Surprisingly, I found that despite changing project ideas during the assignment, therefore pushing our progress back a bit, we were still able to adapt and complete our tasks within the timeframe given. For me personally I knew that I could trust everyone to work on the project whereas with other groups I’ve been a part of/seen, changing project ideas may not have worked as well. In terms of what could be improved, we could try to stick to deadlines and communicate with each other a bit better. I’ve learned that it’s important to try to have different roles in the group so that each area of the project can be covered well.
            </p>
        
        <h4><u>Sing Ho</u></h4>
            <p>Overall, the group worked fairly well together, just like in the previous assignment, we were able to complete our task in a given time frame and delegating the different sections of the assignment was no issue. For this project we tried to have more collaboration between members when working, so we assigned multiple members to work on a task together to further encourage communication but there are still some aspects we could work on as it isn’t always perfect when trying to interact with each other. Time management was also a bit of a struggle because everyone has their own priorities outside of this project. Something I found surprising was that, even though we were behind schedule due to us changing project ideas, we still managed to get our tasks done. Throughout this project, I learned that communication and collaboration is something important between members when trying to achieve successful results.
            </p>
        
        <h4><u>Duc Nguyen</u></h4>
            <p>We worked very well together as a team but also everyone did their best for the individual part that they were assigned. Everyone is trying to help others if they finish their parts. Everyone balanced out their other subjects to complete this assignment so well. We have weekly meetings and discussions to see if anyone has any troubles, other members are willing to help and push the progress. Sweta and Taneshwar once again step up and use their leadership skills and lead everyone to make sure everything is under control and encourage everyone else to finish up others parts.</p>
        
        <h4><u>Nicholas</u></h4>
            <p>Once again our group worked well, however this time we worked much better together instead of individually. Due to the group deciding on a completely different project idea from what we were originally doing, we ended up finishing much later than when we were expected to finish, however we still ended up meeting out deadlines, albeit a bit tight. Everyone was able to balance work between all of their subjects well enough to not notice anyone in particular lagging behind and if anyone did slack someone else would pick up the pace for them. For this project we focused more on collaboration when we assigned tasks to each member and tried to be more open with working with each other even if we didn’t need to. I think we could have improved by properly deciding on our project idea instead of us changing it after we had begun working on the assignment, as this cost us a significant amount of time. I’ve learnt that as a team we can rely on each other a bit more to distribute the work loads so everyone doesn't get overwhelmed with their tasks.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Group Reflection</h3>
            <p>Our group consists of Sweta, Taneshwar, Sing, Minh, Kimberley and Nicholas. We believe we worked really well together as a team, we worked better together this time as we had worked together previously and knew each other more. Something that was surprising was that we worked really collaboratively together but were able to individualise our work. 
            <br><br>
            In terms of choosing our project idea, we gave a chance to everyone to contribute their ideas about assignment. Our goal was to produce the most tangible project idea possible. We discussed all the ideas carefully and then we mentioned them in our individual assignments and discussed further here in Assignment 3. After everyone’s projects were assessed we met as a group and decided on what we thought would work the best. The group tried to arrive at an agreement that makes sense to everyone. Decisions are important for a group. So, we were quite careful in deciding. Our group made all the decisions based on all members’ input and chose to do Sweta’s idea of RMIT PiXel. 
            <br><br>
            We could have everyone engaging more often and talking more. We believed that a lot of our project was focused just on our assignment however it would have been nice to use some time to get to know each other better outside of university. Overall, we all did a great job and would be happy to work together again!
